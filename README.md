# Simplifying Legal Content

This is the frontend and backend code for my dissertation on simplifying legal content. The repository consists of a web interface created with Svelte, and a FastAPI/PyTorch/TensorFlow backend.

## Setup / Requirements

To run the project, both the frontend and backend must be running concurrently. The models required are included within the backend directories, and use the appropriate format for an exported model.

## Starting the interface

### Backend
To start the backend, navigate into the backend directory and run the command:

```poetry run start```

### Frontend
To start the frontend, navigate into the frontend direction and run the command:

```pnpm run dev```
