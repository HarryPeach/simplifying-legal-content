Our ad and business partners share information with us such as browser cookie IDs, Twitter-generated identifiers, mobile device IDs, hashed user information like email addresses, demographic or interest data, and content viewed or actions taken on a website or app. Some of our ad partners, particularly our advertisers, also enable us to collect similar information directly from their website or app by integrating our advertising technology. Information shared by ad partners and affiliates or collected by Twitter from the websites and apps of ad partners and affiliates may be combined with the other information you share with Twitter and that Twitter receives, generates, or infers about you described elsewhere in this Privacy Policy. Other Third Parties, Account Connections, and Integrations. We may receive information about you from third parties who are not our ad partners, such as other Twitter users, developers, and partners who help us evaluate the safety and quality of content on our platform, our corporate affiliates, and other services you link to your Twitter account. You may choose to connect your Twitter account to your account on another service, and that other service may send us information about your account on that service.",
        "1. When you give it to us or give us permission to obtain it When you sign up for or use Pinterest, you voluntarily share certain information including your name, email address, phone number, photos, Pins, comments and any other information you give us. You can also choose to share your precise location using your device settings or via photos. We will still use your IP address, which is used to approximate your location, even if you don't choose to share your precise location. You will also have the option to share other information about yourself such as your gender, age and preferred language. If you connect your Facebook, Google(opens in a new window) or other third-party accounts to Pinterest, we use information from those accounts (such as your friends or contacts) to improve your Pinterest experience. This is dependent on the privacy policies or settings for those accounts. 2. We also get technical information when you use Pinterest When you use a website, mobile application or other Internet service, certain Internet and electronic network activity information gets created and logged automatically. This is also true when you use Pinterest. Here are some of the types of information we collect: Log data. When you use Pinterest, our servers record information (“log data”), including information that your browser automatically sends whenever you visit a website, or that your mobile app automatically sends when you’re using it. This log data includes your Internet Protocol address (which we use to infer your approximate location), the address of and activity on websites you visit that incorporate Pinterest features (such as the “Save” button – more details below), searches, browser type and settings, the date and time of your request, how you used Pinterest, cookie data and device data. You can learn more about the log data we collect here. Cookie data. We also use “cookies” (small text files sent by your computer each time you visit our website, unique to your Pinterest account or your browser) or similar technologies to get log data. When we use cookies or other similar technologies, we use session cookies (that last until you close your browser) or persistent cookies (that last until you or your browser delete them). For example, we use cookies to store your language preferences or other settings so you don‘t have to set them up every time you visit Pinterest. Some of the cookies we use are associated with your Pinterest account (including information about you, such as the email address you gave us) and other cookies are not. For more detailed information about how we use cookies, please review our Cookies Policy(opens in a new window). Device information. In addition to log data, we collect information about the device you’re using Pinterest on, including the type of device, operating system, settings, unique device identifiers and crash data that helps us understand when something breaks. Clickstream data and inferences. When you’re on Pinterest, we use your activity – such as the Pins you click on, the boards you create and any text you add in a comment or description – along with information you provided when you first signed up, and information from our partners and advertisers to make inferences about you and your preferences. For example, if you create a board about travel, we may infer that you are a travel enthusiast. We may also infer information about your education or professional experience based on your activity when you link your account to accounts you have with third parties such as Facebook and Google. 3. Our partners and advertisers share information with us We also get information about you and your activity outside Pinterest from our affiliates, advertisers, partners and other third parties we work with. For example: Some websites or apps use Pinterest features such as our “Save” button, or you may install our “Save” button for your browser. If so, we collect log data from those sites or apps. You can learn more about these features at our Help Center. Online advertisers or third parties share information with us to measure, report on or improve the performance of ads on Pinterest, or to work out what kinds of ads to show you on or off Pinterest. This includes information about your visits to an advertiser's site or purchases you've made from them, or information about your interests from a third-party service, which we might use to help show you ads. Learn more about the types of information advertisers or other third parties share with us. What we do with the info we collect We’re committed to showing you content that’s relevant, interesting and personal to you. To do that, we use your information to provide and improve your experience, including: Identify you when you use Pinterest. Recommend Pins, boards, topics or categories you might like based on your activity on Pinterest. For example, if we see you’re into cooking, we may suggest food-related Pins, boards or people that we think you might like, or show you food-related ads. Respond to your questions or comments. We have a legitimate interest for using your info in these ways. It's fundamental to what we do at Pinterest and necessary in order to make Pinterest and its features relevant and personalised to you. We also have a legitimate interest in making Pinterest safe and improving our product features so you keep finding the inspiration you want. We all benefit when we use your information to: Suggest other people who have similar interests. For example, if you follow interior design boards, we may suggest interior designers that you might like. Help your friends and contacts find you on Pinterest. For example, if you sign up using a Facebook account, we can help your Facebook friends find you on Pinterest when they first sign up for Pinterest. Or people can search for your account on Pinterest using your email address. work with law enforcement and keep Pinterest safe. We may get requests for account information from law enforcement, for example, the police or courts. To find out more about how we respond to law enforcement requests, please see our Law Enforcement Guidelines. Review your messages on Pinterest to detect activity that poses a risk to the safety of you, our community and/or members of the public. Conduct analytics and research on who is using Pinterest and what they are doing. For example, by logging how often people use two different versions of a feature on Pinterest, we can understand which version is better. improve Pinterest and offer new features. Advertise Pinterest products and services to you on other sites. You can choose for us not to share your information with other sites to personalise those ads as described in the “Choices you have about your information” section below. Send you updates (such as when certain activity, such as saves or comments, happens on Pinterest) and news by email or push notification, depending on your settings. For example, we send weekly updates that include Pins you may like. You can decide to stop getting these notifications by updating your settings. We have a legitimate interest in delivering ads that are relevant, interesting and personal to you in order to generate revenue. To further these interests, we use the information we collect to: Decide which ads to show you. For example, if you show an interest in camping tents on Pinterest, we may show you ads for other outdoor products. We customise the ad content we show you by identifying your interests based on your onsite and offsite activities, as well as by using information we receive from ad partners or other third parties. Where we use cookies to identify your offsite interests, we’ll get your consent where we need to. Where ad partners or other third parties share information with us about you, we rely on the consent they have already obtained. Tell our ad partners how their Pinterest ads are doing, and how to make them better. Some of this information is aggregated. For example, we would report to an advertiser that a certain percentage of people who viewed an ad went on to visit that advertiser's site. In other instances, this information isn’t aggregated. For example, we would let an advertiser know that a particular ad has been saved by certain people. To find out more about reporting on ads, please visit the Help Centre. We have a legitimate interest in using information we collect to customise your Pinterest experience based on your offsite behaviour. For example, if you visit websites that sell electric guitars, we may suggest guitar-related Pins to you. When we identify your interests based on your offsite behaviour with cookies, we (or our partners) will obtain any consent that we need. To find out more about how we use cookies, please see our Cookie Policy. In addition to the specific circumstances above, we’ll only use your information with your consent in order to: Allow searching with photos. For example, if you take a photo of a pair of shoes or a piece of furniture you like, you can ask us to show you similar items. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings. Send you marketing materials by email, text, push notification or phone call depending on your account or operating system settings. Each time we send you marketing materials, we give you the option to unsubscribe. Identify your precise location and customise the content we show you. For example, if we know that you’re near a retailer, we may show you that retailer’s Pins that may be of interest to you. You can opt in to this in your device operating system settings. Tell our ad partners how their ads are doing using the Pinterest tag. The Pinterest tag (a piece of code an advertiser puts on their site) delivers insights to us and our ad partners about actions that a person takes on their website after viewing an ad on Pinterest. To learn more about the Pinterest tag, please visit the Help Centre. We’ll also rely on your consent where we use cookies to show you ads you might be interested in. We use cookies to identify your interests based on your offsite activity. We do this for people currently using Pinterest and for new users, and it helps us customise how you get started on Pinterest. To find out more about how we use cookies, and your choices about how we use them, please see our Cookies Policy. Transferring your information Pinterest is a worldwide service. By using our products or services, you authorise us to transfer and store your information outside your home country, including in the United States, for the purposes described in this policy.

Secret boards are visible to you and other collaborators in the board, and any collaborator may choose to make the board available to anyone else. For example, another collaborator can invite someone else to the board, make the board available to an app they use to view Pinterest, or even just take an image from the board and email it to their friends. Choose whether Pinterest will be customised for you using information from other websites or apps. If you have a Pinterest account and want to control how your offsite data is used to tailor your experience, you can visit your settings and update your “Personalisation” preferences.

We may also retain certain information in our backup systems for a limited period of time, or as required by law. We also support settings such as Limit ad tracking on iOS, Ad personalisation on Android devices as well as Do Not Track in browsers. Learn more about how Do Not Track affects our collection and use of data collected off Pinterest. You also have choices available to you through the device or software you use to access Pinterest.

Your mobile device lets you choose how and whether your precise location, photos, contacts and other data are shared with us. To learn more about these choices, please see the information provided by your device or software provider. How and when we share information Anyone can see the public boards and Pins you create and profile information you give us.

For example, a partner can study what their most popular Pins are or how their Pins are being shared on Pinterest by using a Pinterest API. We also share your information with: Other services, at your direction, to enable you to sign up for or log in to Pinterest, or when you decide to link your Pinterest account to those services, such as Facebook or Google, or when you publish your content on Pinterest to them. For example, if you choose to publish your Pins to Facebook or Twitter, information about that content will be shared with Facebook or Twitter.

We only share information if we believe that disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety, rights or property of the public, any person or Pinterest; or to detect, prevent or otherwise address fraud, security or technical issues. Our wholly owned subsidiaries and affiliates. If we were to engage in a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, reorganisation, or similar transaction or proceeding that involves the transfer of the information described in this Policy, we would share your information with a party involved in such a process (for example, a potential purchaser). How long we keep your information for We only keep your information for as long as we need it to provide Pinterest to you and fulfil the purposes described in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on our behalf.
